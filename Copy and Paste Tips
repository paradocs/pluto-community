Yes, we need Pasting Notebooks.  It is excellent to:
  - Distinguish Pluto as the easiest to use notebook
  - Let un-trained teachers/users run Pluto in a moment
  - Fit in with Pluto's outstanding readable file   
  - E-mail makes sharing and searching notebooks fast
  - Allow a binder session to start several notebooks

Fixing or warning of a faulty copy is good.
Check both start ### A Pluto.jl  and end   # ╠═
 
To select a complete notebook in a g-mail,
at the end of a web-page, or of a text file 
place the cursor on the line above the 2nd #,
left click and move diagonally to the margin. 
This method requires a blank line above.
If we start after the first # all we miss
is one #.  Just correct this pragmatically.
