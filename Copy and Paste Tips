Yes, we need Pasting Notebooks.  It is excellent to:
* Distinguish Pluto as the easiest to use notebook
* Let un-trained teachers/users run Pluto in a moment
* Fit in with Pluto's outstanding readable file   
* E-mail for fast sharing and searching of notebooks
* Allow a binder session to start several notebooks

Fixing or warning of a faulty copy is good.
Check both start ### A Pluto.jl  and end   # ╠═
 
To select a complete notebook at the end of
a g-mail, a web-page, or a text file just 
place the cursor on the line above the 2nd #,
left click and move diagonally to the margin. 
This method requires a blank line above.
If we start after the first #, we only miss
one #.  Just correct this pragmatically.
