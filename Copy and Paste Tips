To select a complete notebook at the end of
a g-mail, a web-page, or a text file just 
place the cursor on the line above the 2nd #,
left click and move diagonally to the margin. 
This method requires a blank line above.
If we start after the first #, we only miss
one #.  We hope to correct this pragmatically.

CTRL a works if only the code is on the page.
