We wish to modify Pluto notebooks so that
open with pasted code rather than a file.
This is aimed to ease shared computers,
online computing, and limited devices
like chrmobooks.  Code would be selected
from e-mail, web pages, or shared files.
A notebook would be restarted with this code.
The work would be saved with copy and paste
into an e-mail.  We are using this model:

       "Pluto Community Use Model"
