We will make Pluto notebooks available by
simply pasting code, without using files.
No login or place to store files in needed.
It just takes an e-mail account and a browser.
An empty Pluto Notebook is brought up online. 
A class can get up and running in minutes so
it can be used for even an occasional lesson. 
Notebooks are sent out and returned by e-mail.
This will work in cost effective chromebooks.
Code is selected from e-mails, web pages, or
files opened in a text editor to be pasted.
A notebook will be restarted with pasted code.

We are using this model:
