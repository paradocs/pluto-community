We wish to implement Pluto notebooks so that
they open with pasted code rather than a file.
This is aimed to ease use on shared computers,
for online computing, and limited devices
like chrmebooks.  Code would be selected
from e-mails, web pages, or opened files.
A notebook would be restarted with this code.
The work would be saved with copy and paste
into an e-mail.  The code may be considered
"stateless" as it will not be in a .jl file.
We are using this model:

       "Pluto Community Use Model"
