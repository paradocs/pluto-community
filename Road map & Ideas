We will make Pluto notebooks more available
by simple code pasting, without using files.
No login or place to store files is needed.
It only takes an e-mail account and a browser.
A class can get going in minutes so notebooks
can even be used for an occasional lesson.
An empty Pluto Notebook is brought up online. 
Start, share, and save Notebooks by e-mail.
This works well in cost effective chromebooks.
Code, to be pasted, is selected from e-mails,
web pages, or files opened in a text editors.
A notebook is restarted with just pasted code.
