# pluto-e-mail
With pluto-e-mail (PEM); Pluto Notebooks, Markdown, and
the Julia language are available to a wide community.
Our mission is giving tips and tricks to allow learners
and casual users to feel a home in a Pluto Notebook.
Work anywhere with nothing to set up.  Use only an
inexpensive device, internet, e-mail and an up-to-date
Chrome or Firefox browser.  Julia is Fantastic, Pluto
is Super and PEM makes the experience even Better!
